# Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality Analysis (2000–2020)

This project analyzes global cancer trends using:
- CI5plus (IARC) population-based cancer incidence data
- WHO Mortality Database

## Objectives
- Analyze long-term global cancer incidence and mortality trends
- Compare incidence and mortality at a global level
- Identify cancer types with high mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIR)

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Data Sources
- CI5plus (IARC): https://ci5.iarc.fr
- WHO Mortality Database: https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/who-mortality-database

## Notes
Incidence data are registry-based, while mortality data are national-level.
MIR values are approximate and should be interpreted with caution.
